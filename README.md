## Project Goals

The primary goal of Wheelmaster is to create an engaging and user-friendly B2B and B2C e-commerce platform for purchasing high-quality wheelbarrows and other construction equipment.The project is fully responsive across different screen sizes.

## Agile

I used the GitHub Projects tool to manage the various tasks and processes required to complete this project. Initially, I created the project titled "Wheel Master" on GitHub and linked it to the Wheelmaster_p5 repository. This project board helped track the progress of user stories and can be viewed [here](https://github.com/users/mufasa1611/projects/12).

In total, there are 11 user stories, of which 9 have the label "must have". All were moved throughout the development cycle from "To Do" to "In Progress" to "Done."

Details about the individual user stories, their associated Acceptance Criteria, Tasks, Labels, and Epics can be found under their respective links as follows:

[#1 User Story: Browse by Category, Must Have](https://github.com/mufasa1611/Wheelmaster_p5/issues/1)

## Design

### Database Model

The Database Diagram was created with [dbdiagram](https://dbdiagram.io/d)

![Database Diagram](media/images/erd.jpg)

### Wireframes

Wireframes for the project were designed using Balsamiq. Below is a preview of the desktop, tablet, and mobile layouts.

Desktop view Homepage:

![Desktop view Homepage wire](media/images/desktop.view.wire.jpg)

Mobile view Homepage:

![Mobile view Homepage wire](media/images/mobile.view.wire.jpg)

Desktop view Products Page:

![Desktop Products Page wire](media/images/product.view.desktop.wire.jpg)

Desktop view Product details:

![Desktop Product detail wire](media/images/product.detail.wire.jpg)

### Color Scheme

I chose not to use a predefined template color scheme in order to maintain a simple and intuitive design. The focus was on usability, clear navigation, and ensuring the products remain the central visual element of the site.

### Typography

- Primary Font: Lato Family
- Secondary Font: Ariel Sans Serif
- Fallback Font: Sans Serif

I chose the Lato family and Open Sans Serif because they are commonly used, clean, and modern fonts that enhance readability, providing a user-friendly experience. Using widely adopted fonts is considered a best practice, as they are optimized for web use and ensure consistency across different devices and browsers.

### Images

All product images are courtesy of my employer, Altrad Hofmaninger. Only the landing page image was created with AI and eidted for better visibility and contrast.

### Responsiveness

Wheelmaster is fully responsive across all screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. On smaller screen sizes, the menu collapses to a drop-down menu containing all the links on the Header, the search bar is replaced with a small search icon, the account icon and shopping bag icon remain and a home icon appears to link directly to the home page.

Mobile view:

The fixed Header features the Wheelmaster logo on the left, which is also a link to the home page, a search engine field in the middle, a "My Account" icon on the right side, as well as a shopping bag icon. When clicking on "My Account", a drop-down box shows "login" and "register". The logged in user sees "My Profile" and "Logout" in the drop-down box.

Beneath are links to the four main categories "All Products", "Construction Tools", "Equipment" and "Special Offers", all showing a drop-down menu when clicked. When hovering over a sub-category inside the drop-down menu, another drop-down box appears with an arrow to choose nested categories where applicable.

The Products Page showcases the available Products with their Name, Price and Rating. They can be sorted in many ways, ascending and descending. This page also features a little "Up Arrow" icon in the right bottom corner, which scrolls slowly up to the to of the page.

![Product Details Page](media/images/product.info.page.png)

The Product Details Page features a product image, the name, price, category, rating, a short description which can be extracted to a longer description by clicking on the "show more" link. It also shows the available stock quantity and offers an easy and intuitive way to add any available quantity to the shopping bag. It is not possible to add 0 pieces and not possible to add more than the available stock.

#### Shopping bag Page

![Shopping bag Page](media/images/shopping.bag.png)

Bag Notification: If the user currently has nothing in their bag they will just see a bag icon. If the user adds a product to their bag, it will appear with the checkout amount of their order in their bag. The user can add or remove quantities to his order or delete the item from his bag. When adding any item to the bag, the user is prompted with a toast message information on how much they would need to spend more for free shipment.

#### Secure Checkout Page

![Secure Checkout](media/images/checkout.png)

To ensure secure and reliable payment processing for customers, I used Stripe as the payment processor. The user is shown the shipment costs information and the total order amount. Upon filling their personal data and completing the checkout with stripe, their order gets confirmed on the successful checkout page with all the details of their order and the same information is being sent to them by email.

#### My Profile Page

![My Profile Page](media/images/my.profile.png)

When clickign on "My Account", the user has the choice to click on "My Profile", where the registered user finds his personal details and his order history with order numbers, dates and total amounts of the orders. If they click on any order number, they are shown the complete details of this order.

![Order History](media/images/order-history.png)

#### Signout Page

If the signed-in user clicks on "signout" in the sub-menu of "My account", they are prompted to confirm their wish to sign out on the Signout Page. The successful signout is confirmed by a toast message.

![signout](media/images/sign.out.png)

#### About Us page

![About Us Page](media/images/about.us.png)

The About Us Page link in the drop-down menu of "About Us" in the Header, links to the "About Us" page with a short description and history of the company. In the future, more details about the team, including their direct contact information and photos, could be added.

#### Contact Us page

![Contact Us Page](media/images/contact-us.png)

![Google maps](media/images/maps-on-contactus.png)

#### Newsletter sign-up

![Newsletter signup](media/images/newsletter-signup.png)

The Newsletter sign up Page features a form prompting the user to fill in his name and e-mail address. When clicking on the blue "subscribe now" button, an e-mail is sent to the entered e-mail address to confirm the identy of the user. When the user confirms the subscription in their e-mail, they receive another e-mail confirming the successful subscription. Also on the Webpage the user is informed by toast messages of successful subscription, errors or if they are subscribed already.

#### Error 404, 403 and 500 Pages

![404 Error Page](media/images/404.png)

A customized Error 404, 403 and 500 Error Pages to provide a user-friendly message and navigation options to help users return to the main site when a page is not found.

### Additional Pages for Admins (Superusers)

- Product Management Pages
- Inventory Management Page

#### Product Management Page

Staff and Admin can add, delete and edit products, descriptions, images, sizes and prices.

Product add Page

![Product add Page](media/images/eidt.product-admin.png)

Products overview edit

![Products overview edit](media/images/products.edit-admin.png)

#### Inventory Management Page

On the Inventory Management Page, the admin can add, delete, edit categories, sub-categories, nested categories, prices, quantitites, etc. They can view total stocks, stocks reserved in the shopping bags at the moment and available items.

![Inventory Management Page](media/images/inventory.admin.png)

#### Inventory Logic

The available stock quantity is set by the admin. On the product details page, the available quantity is shown and when a valid quantity of a product is being added to the shopping bag, the available quantity decreases on the product details page and also on the Inventory Management Page. It is not possible to add more quantity than available to a shopping bag, and also inside the shopping bag, invalid quantities can not be entered and will trigger error toast messages. If the user decreases the quantity of a product in his bag, or deletes the item(s), those quantities are freed up again and added to the total available quantities of this product on the product details page and also on the Inventory Management Page.
